# Residency calculator for CZ aLiEnS

As a foreigner in Czech republic, you have an opportunity to get **permanent residency** after 5 years of continuous (uninterrupted) residency. The issue is that different
residency types counts differently in this length of stay period: for example, if you are staying as a student with 23/24 type of residency, then 1 day of this stay counts as 0.5 day
of length of stay for permanent residency.

This application helps users to calculate their length of stay accordingly.

The app is created as a part of exploring [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) capabilities to build simple static web pages. It is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and moved to the domain name I owned. You can test the app here:
